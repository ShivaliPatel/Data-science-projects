### Introduction 

Customer segmentation is one of the most important metrices for growing companies to evaluate. While it's not the happiest measure, it's a number that give companies the hard truth about its customer retention strategy. 

**What is Customer Chrun?**<br>
Customer Churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using company's product/service during a certain time frame. THe calculation for  **customer churn** is diving the number of customers company lost during that time period by the number of customers company had at the beginning of that time period.

For example, if company had 400 customers at the beginning of the year and end with 360, means company's churn rate is 10%, because compant lost 10% of the the customer from the base. Most companies try to decrease churn rate as 0%.
