# Telecom customer churn

**Dataset** : Telco customer churn<br>
**Source** : https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn ( IBM Sample dataset)

Here, IBM provided customer data for Telco industry to predict behaviour of the customers. Main objective is that to analyze customer behavious and develop strategies for customer retention.

Dataset has information related,

Demographic: gender, age range and if they have any partner or dependent.
Usage: User has phone or internet service. Also information related to multiline phone, streaming services and many more.
Account type: How long they have been a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges.

To solve this problem, I divided into different notebooks
1) <a href='https://github.com/ShivaliPatel/Data-science-projects/blob/master/Telco_customer_churn/Telco%20customer%20churn%20-%20Exploratory%20data%20analysis%20(EDA).ipynb'>Exploratory Data Analysis </a>: 
Objective is to explore domain and understand dataset and find relationship between variables. Also, I explored different clusters within churn customers.

I wanted to start with simple model to predict Churn customers. Logistic regression is the simple and easiest one to start to solve Classification problem. Here, I have measured outcome of model using different evalution matrices.
